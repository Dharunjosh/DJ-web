      The Professor (Sergio Marquina) is a fictional character in the Netflix
      series Money Heist, portrayed by Alvaro Morte. He is the mastermind of the
      heist who assembled the group, as well as Berlin's brother. <br />The
      Professor, real name Sergio, was born in San Sebastian and mostly grew up
      in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the gang, and is the one
      who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank
      of Spain. He is sophisticated but nerdy. The idea of the first heist is to
      avenge his father, whose idea it originally was. His grandfather had
      fought against the fascists in Italy. He was the mastermind behind the
      plans of the two heists. He controlled the heist through a hiding outside
      the Royal Mint. <br />
      The Professor falls in love with Raquel Murillo, a police investigator
      leading the case against the heist. Under the false identity of Salvador
      "Salva" Mart√≠n, he was able to get closer to the lead inspector assigned
      to the Royal Mint robbery, Raquel Murillo, and the pair eventually fell in
      love. Raquel then joins the gang by the name "Lisbon". He sleeps with her
      and when her mother finds out about his involvement with the heist, he
      attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last second, opting to take
      advantage of her poor memory and deleting the voicemail. <br />The
      Professor spent years of his life meticulously planning the heist, and
      covered aspects that most people wouldn‚Äôt think of. His tactic was to lead
      the police to several dead ends to buy more time for the money to be
      printed and the team to escape.
